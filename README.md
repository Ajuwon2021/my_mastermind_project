# Welcome to My Mastermind
***

## Task
The task is to implement the classic game 'Mastermind'.

## Description
Mastermind is a code-breaking game where players attempt to guess a secret code of a certain length composed of digits. Players are given a limited number of attempts to guess the code. After each guess, players receive feedback on how many digits they guessed correctly and how many digits were correct but in the wrong position.

## Installation
Compile the program using the following command:
~> gcc -o my_mastermind my_mastermind.c


## Usage
Run the program using the command:
~> ./my_mastermind [-c CODE] [-t ATTEMPTS]

Use the -c flag to specify a custom secret code. The -t flag allows you to set the number of attempts available to the player. If these flags are omitted, a random secret code will be generated, and the player will have 10 attempts.
